# Prework study guide webpage

## Description


The motivation behind my work is the pursuit of further knowledge concerning web-development and various coding languages.
I built this website for the purpose of having a means to navigate all the info I have learnt thus far, in order to apply it in an easier fashion.
It allows me to keep all the information organized within a tight-knit webpage from which one can refer to in incase any material is forgotten.
As things stand, I have learned the rudimentary basics concerning HTML/CSS/JAVA, as well as a fair amount in relation to the use of git bash and git hub.

## Usage

This webpage contains four sections, one for each HTML/CSS/JAVA/README, from which one can read in order to study pertinent points/key information pertaining said subjects. There is also built-in java that lists the study subjects as well as picking one at random in order to learn.
